        <h1>PSILO</h1>
        <h2>A Scientific Perspective</h2>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper presents the conceptual framework and anticipated launch of PSILO, an
            experimental cryptocurrency themed around mycology. The intent is to create a scientific yet
            community-driven digital asset with unique NFT representations of documented fungal species.</p>
        <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> The intersection of decentralized finance and natural sciences is an emerging
            field, with fungi serving as both a symbolic and literal model of decentralized networks. This document
            outlines the initial roadmap for PSILO and its NFT ecosystem.</p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Further updates and technical specifications will be released as development
            progresses. Stay tuned.</p>
